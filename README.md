# AsciiMath

AsciiMath is a compiler from the amazing [asciimath](http://asciimath.org/)
language to LaTeX.

The aim of that project is to provide a Haskell Library and a command line tool
making possible to use asciimath everywhere, for example in interaction with
[pandoc](http://pandoc.org/scripting.html).

## TODO
